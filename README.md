The Smart Floor Cleaning Robot using IoT is an intelligent automation project designed to clean indoor floors efficiently and autonomously. Equipped with sensors for obstacle detection and path tracking, the robot navigates around the room while cleaning dust and debris using rotating brushes and a suction mechanism. IoT connectivity allows users to control the robot remotely, monitor cleaning status, and schedule cleaning tasks through a mobile app or web interface. The system improves convenience, reduces manual effort, and provides smart home automation features, making it ideal for modern households and IoT-based robotics projects.
